# Variable Definitions

### General input attributes:
age (numeric)

job - type of job (categorical: "admin.","blue-collar","entrepreneur","housemaid","management","retired","self-employed","services","student","technician","unemployed","unknown")

marital : marital status (categorical: "divorced","married","single","unknown"; note: "divorced" means divorced or widowed)

education (categorical: "basic.4y","basic.6y","basic.9y","high.school","illiterate","professional.course","university.degree","unknown") 

default: has credit in default? (categorical: "no","yes","unknown")

housing: has housing loan? (categorical: "no","yes","unknown")

loan: has personal loan? (categorical: "no","yes","unknown")

### Input attributes related to the last contact of the current campaign:
contact: contact communication type (categorical: "cellular","telephone")

month: last contact month of year (categorical: "jan", "feb", "mar", ..., "nov", "dec")

day_of_week: last contact day of the week (categorical: "mon","tue","wed","thu","fri")

duration: last contact duration, in seconds (numeric). Important note: the duration variable is unknown before the sales call is finished

### Historical attributes (campaign related):
campaign: number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client (numeric, includes last contact)

pdays: number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (numeric; 999 means client was not previously contacted)

previous: number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this client (numeric)

poutcome: outcome of the previous marketing campaign (categorical: "failure","nonexistent","success")

### Socio-economic context variables:
emp.var.rate: employment variation rate - quarterly indicator (numeric)

cons.price.idx: consumer price index - monthly indicator (numeric)     

cons.conf.idx: consumer confidence index - monthly indicator (numeric)     

euribor3m: euribor 3 month rate - daily indicator (numeric)

nr.employed: number of employees - quarterly indicator (numeric)


# Question 1

## Question 1a
Check for linear correlations between the input variables (numeric)

```{r 1a}
# remove non-numeric columns
data_numeric_only <- data %>% select_if(is.numeric)

# now we can create our corrplot
M <- cor(data_numeric_only)
corrplot(M, method = "number", tl.col = "black", type = "upper")
```
Yes, there are a few variables positively correlated with each other and a select few negatively correlated. Of note, `emp.var.rate` is positively correlated with `cons.price.idx`, `euribor3m`, and `nr.employed` >0.78 for each.

## Question 1b

## Question 1c

```{r 1c}
# pearson chi square

# data_categorical_only <- data %>% select_if(is.character)

categorical_only = select_if(data, is.factor)
# Test independence by using Chi-square test)
for(col in names(categorical_only)){
  if (col != "y"){
    test_data = subset(bank_full_data, select = c(col, "y"))
    print(table(test_data))
    print(chisq.test(table(test_data)))
  }
}
```
